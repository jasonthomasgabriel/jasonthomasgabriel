# Hi, I'm Tommy

I'm a composer/musician, and a theatre sound and light technician. I love travelling and messing about with computers.

For some (older) composition work, see my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jasonthomasgabriel/). And below you may find some Lilypond projects. If you need a custom-tailored composition, feel free to message me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jasonthomasgabriel).
